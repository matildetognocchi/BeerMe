# Beer Me 🍻

## Description 
Welcome to my project! Beer ME is an app made in Swift using the UiKit framework. It allows users to discover new beers.


## Goal of this project 
An essential part of my journey in iOS Development is putting into practice the concepts I've been studying in the past months. 
With this in mind, **I've created a project where I can work on:** 

1. **👨🏽‍🎨 Design:**
   The app will present 4 main views for starters...
   -  The "Opening" view
   -  The "Explore New Beers" view - find new interesting beers 
   -  The "Beer Details" view - display the beer details 
   -  The "Favourite List" view - collect all your favourite beers
     
     Nice to add in the future
   -  The "Reviewed Beers List" view - collect the reviews and notes you add after trying a new beer
   -  The "Breweries Map" view - display a map with the nearest breweries 

3. **👩🏻‍💻 UiKit:**

5. **☎️ API calls:**
   For all the data about beers I'm using the free API https://random-data-api.com/api/v2/beers

   
6. **📂 GitHub:**
   My first approach to GitHub features
